tssem1 function in [metaSEM](https://github.com/mikewlcheung/metasem) package uses a list data, which includes a "son" list of covariance matrix and a vector of sample size (maybe also another vector of cluster). This data format differs a lot from the wide format we used usually. In the wide format data, one row includes information for one study, hence I arrange the correlations in a matrix (usually one matrix for one study) from top to down and from left to right successively in a row. In the manual of metaSEM package, Cheung calls this kind of layout of matrix a "stacked matrix". The question is, how can I transform such stacked matrix into the list needed for meta-analytic analysis (i.e., tssem1 function) ? In this article, I write one function to do such work.
Firstly, let's have a look at the data used by `tssem1` function.
```{r}
library(metaSEM)
data(Cheung09)
Cheung09
```
For presentation purpose, I transform the list to wide data.
``` {r}
stackeData <- data.frame(list2matrix(Cheung09$data, diag = TRUE))
stackeData["n"]<- Cheung09$n
# Create a column to save study names or study IDs.
stackeData["studyName"] <- paste0("study",1:4)
stackeData
```
Now you can use the function below. Note that the orders of the covariances in data frame must be consistent with the order `vec2symMat` function fills the matrix. That's from top to down and from left to right. This function has 6 arguments.

- `dataFrame` = the data frame including all data or information. 
- `nCol` = the column number including the sample size.
- `studyNameCol` = the number of the colume including study names or study IDs.
- `fromCol` = the number of the start column to read the stacked matrix (i.e., a series of covariances/correlations).
- `toCol` = the number of the end column to read the stacked matrix.
- `dimNamesVector` = the dimension names of the covariance matrices. Again, the order should be consistent with the matrix.

Now, run the following syntax to define the function `create_metaSEM_data` function before you use it. 
``` {r}
# Define a function to prepare data for metaSEM.
create_metaSEM_data <-
  function (dataFrame,
            nCol,
            studyNameCol,
            fromCol,
            toCol,
            dimNamesVector) {
    studyNames <- as.vector(t(dataFrame[, studyNameCol]))
    sampleSize <- as.vector(t(dataFrame[, nCol]))
    cor_matrix_list <- list()
    cor_n <- vector()
    for (i in 1:nrow(dataFrame)) {
      cor_matrix <- vec2symMat(t(dataFrame[i, fromCol:toCol]))
      rownames(cor_matrix) <-
        colnames(cor_matrix) <- dimNamesVector
      if (is.na(is.pd(cor_matrix)))
        cat(paste("Incomplete data:", studyNames[i]), "\n")
      else {
        cor_matrix_list[[studyNames[i]]] <- cor_matrix
        cor_n[studyNames[i]] <- sampleSize[i]
      }
    }
    return(list(cor_matrix_list = cor_matrix_list, cor_n = cor_n))
  }
```
Then, have a try to convert `stackeData` back to the list.
```{r}
names(stackeData) # To find the column number.
semData <- create_metaSEM_data(dataFrame = stackeData,
                               nCol = 46,
                               studyNameCol = 47,
                               fromCol = 1,
                               toCol = 45,
                               dimNamesVector = paste0("x",1:9))
semData
```
In your own work, you must prepare a data frame that fits `create_metaSEM_data` function, indicating that the stacked matrix must be a column-directed (from top to down, from left to right) lower triangle of the matrix including the diagonals. 

Another thing you should keep in mind is that the covariances/correlations of the missing variables **must be kept empty**. For example, there are three elements for the correlation matrix of x1 and x2. If variable x2 is missing, the x1_x2 correlation and x2_x2 correlation should both be kept empty, even though we know x2_x2 correlation is always 1. We keep it empty to tell R this variable is missing. Otherwise, `tssem1` function will treat such a matrix as an incomplete matrix and will give an error, since if x2_x2 correlation exist, x1_x2 should exist too. In other words, `tssem1` allows missing variables, but does not allow incomplete matrices. I have added one step in `create_metaSEM_data` function using `is.pd` function to check whether each matrix is incomplete. If the matrix is incomplete, it will not be included in the created list, and the the corresponding study name will be shown to you for your further inspection.

Hope this function can help you.
