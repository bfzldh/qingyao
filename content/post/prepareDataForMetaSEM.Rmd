tssem1 function in [metaSEM](https://github.com/mikewlcheung/metasem) package uses a list data, which includes a "son" list of covariance matrix and a vector of sample size. This data format differs a lot from the wide format we used usually. In the wide format data, one row includes information for one study, hence I save the correlations in a matrix (usually one matrix for one study) successively in a row. In the manual of metaSEM package, Cheung calls this matrix in a row "stacked matrix". The question is, how can I transform such data into the list needed for meta-analytic analysis (i.e., tssem1 function) ? In this article, I write one function to do such work.
Firstly, let's have a look at the data used by tssem1 function.
```{r}
library(metaSEM)
data(Cheung09)
Cheung09
```
For presentation purpose, I transform the list to wide data.
``` {r}
stackeData <- data.frame(list2matrix(Cheung09$data, diag = TRUE))
stackeData["n"]<- Cheung09$n
# Create a column to save study names or study IDs.
stackeData["studyName"] <- paste0("study",1:4)
stackeData
```
Now you can use the function below. Note that the orders of the covariances in data frame must be consistent with the order `vec2symMat` function fills the matrix. This function has 6 arguments.
- dataFrame = the data frame include all data or information. 
- ncol = the column number of the sample size variable.
- studyNameCol = the number of the colume includes study names or study IDs.
- fromCol = the number of the start column to read the stacked matrix (i.e., a number of covariances).
- to Col = the number of the end column to read the stacked matrix.
- dimNamesVector = the colume (or row) names of the covariance matrices. Again, the order should be consistent with the real matrix.
``` {r}
# Define a function to prepare data for metaSEM.
create_metaSEM_data <-
  function (dataFrame,
            nCol,
            studyNameCol,
            fromCol,
            toCol,
            dimNamesVector) {
    studyNames <- as.vector(t(dataFrame[, studyNameCol]))
    sampleSize <- as.vector(t(dataFrame[, nCol]))
    cor_matrix_list <- list()
    cor_n <- vector()
    for (i in 1:nrow(dataFrame)) {
      cor_matrix <- vec2symMat(t(dataFrame[i, fromCol:toCol]))
      rownames(cor_matrix) <-
        colnames(cor_matrix) <- dimNamesVector
      if (is.na(is.pd(cor_matrix)))
        cat(paste("Incomplete data:", studyNames[i]), "\n")
      else {
        cor_matrix_list[[studyNames[i]]] <- cor_matrix
        cor_n[studyNames[i]] <- sampleSize[i]
      }
    }
    return(list(cor_matrix_list = cor_matrix_list, cor_n = cor_n))
  }
```
Run the function before we use it. Now, we convert `stackeData` back to the list.
```{r}
names(stackeData) # To find the column number.
semData <- create_metaSEM_data(dataFrame = stackeData,
                               nCol = 46,
                               studyNameCol = 47,
                               fromCol = 1,
                               toCol = 45,
                               dimNamesVector = paste0("x",1:9))
semData
```
In your owe work, you must prepare a data frame that fits `create_metaSEM_data` function, indicating that the stacked matrix must be column-directed (from top to down, from left to right) lower triangle of the matrix including the diagonals. Another thing you should keep in mind is that the covariances/correlations of the missing variables must be kept empty. For example, if variable x2 is missing, the diagonal for x2 in a correlation matrix should be kept empty, even we know it's always 1. We keep it empty to tell `is.pd` function this variable is missing. Otherwise, you are not able to convert the data to a list is your matrices include missing values.
Note that I add one "check" step  
Enjoy it!
